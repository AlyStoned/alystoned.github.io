review_body: ClutchPoints is the most innovative sports media company in America, we needed a tech team who would be able to outperform the market as we always do. 4Taps met the expectations to rapidly iterate on our product from the very first release in 2015. They did fantastic job designing, developing our apps and backend for them.
